ALSO MY FIRST README FILE

<!-- This is a Multi Form Web Application that a user can subscribe to any plan they want either yearly or monthly.The project is actually taken from front end mentor to practice typescript. Also, It is not responsive. It is just for practice as the Next Button isnt working well.I already did this vanilla Javascript before and the code is totally different as a sign of improvement.


It is just for typescript practical.Also,I havent used class constructor for any project before its is used  here and the code is so nice and fascinating. Also the error message receiving from typescript is fun as I have searched online to know what's truly means.

CORRECTED ONE FROM CHATGPT

<!-- # Multi-Step Subscription Form (TypeScript Practice)

This is a multi-step web application where users can subscribe to any plan they wantâ€”either **yearly** or **monthly**. Itâ€™s a personal practice project focused on learning and applying **TypeScript** in a real-world UI flow.

> ðŸ§  The project is inspired by a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), used purely for practice and learning TypeScript.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This project is **not responsive** and is **not production-ready**. It is built as a **TypeScript learning exercise**. Previously, this exact project was completed using **vanilla JavaScript**, and this version is a **refactored TypeScript implementation** with an entirely different code structure.

---

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- **Using TypeScript with DOM manipulation**
- Writing and implementing **TypeScript interfaces and types**
- Working with **class constructors** (used here for the first time!)
- Handling **type errors in TypeScript** and learning how to debug them
- Using `NodeListOf`, `HTMLElement`, and strongly typed method signatures

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- HTML / CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (TypeScript DOM API)

---

## ðŸš§ Known Issues

- The **Next** button isn't fully functional in all cases.
- No responsive stylingâ€”designed only for desktop as part of practice.
- Form validation is basic and can be improved.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Plan Selection**: Choose from different subscription plans.
- **Billing Cycle Toggle**: Switch between yearly and monthly plans.
- **Add-On Services**: Select extra services with real-time updates.
- **Summary Page**: Shows total selected services and pricing.

---

## âœ¨ Personal Note

> This project is **just for practice**, and Iâ€™m genuinely enjoying how TypeScript throws errorsâ€”it encourages me to dig deeper, research, and understand whatâ€™s really happening under the hood. Iâ€™m also proud of using class constructors here, something I hadnâ€™t done in my earlier projects!
